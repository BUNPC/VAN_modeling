# VAN_modeling

The vascular anatomical network (VAN) model computes *oxygen distribution*, *blood flow distribution* and *BOLD fMRI signals* within mouse  microvascular stacks obtained in-vivo from two-photon microscopy.

Here we provide instructions to run the code and descriptions of the model.

Any comments are welcome, and we would also love to discuss potential research topics. Emails with any questions can be sent to Xiaojun Cheng xcheng17@bu.edu, David Boas dboas@bu.edu. Most importantly, have fun with VAN!
